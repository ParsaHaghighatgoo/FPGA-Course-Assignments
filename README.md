# FPGA-Course-Assignments

A collection of **FPGA RTL design assignments** implemented in **Verilog/SystemVerilog**, organized by homework and project. These designs cover both fundamental and advanced digital logic topics, including finite state machines, CORDIC DSP modules, LFSR pseudo-random generators, fixed-point arithmetic units, and custom FIFO architectures, along with verification testbenches.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each major homework or project is organized in its own folder:

* **HW2/** – RTL design modules and supporting testbenches
* **HW3/** – FSM-based architectures and control logic
* **HW4/** – DSP-oriented designs and advanced hardware modules

Each folder contains:

* Verilog/SystemVerilog source files
* Corresponding testbenches
* Simulation-ready designs
